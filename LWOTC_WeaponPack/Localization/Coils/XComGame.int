Summary="It is now time to move beyond reverse-engineering captured weapons to develop a new line of magnetic weaponry superior to what ADVENT utilizes."
LongDescription="The principles of coil-type magnetic weapons have long been known, but it has taken our understanding of alien materials and energy supplies to make that a reality. And the reality is we have developed weaponry that exceed the firepower of ADVENT troops and approach that of some alien weaponry. Our coilguns fire rounds sheathed in ablative plastic that melts away as the round travels through the gun barrel at speeds even greater than those achieved by the aliens' railgun-based systems. The round itself can punch through thin armor, as well. R. Tygan."

Summary="We can now turn our attention to developing specialized coil weaponry."
LongDescription="The challenges in adapting our new coilgun designs to fit our defined combat roles were not insigificant; the coils themselves must be precisely machined so the round doesn't lose its way in the barrel, which could have catastrophic consequences for the gun and the user. This may explain why ADVENT never adopted this style of weaponry; they are too expensive and labor-intensive to produce, not really suited for industrial-scale production for a worldwide army of poorly trained clones. They are, however, an excellent fit for a small cadre of expert soldiers. R. Tygan."
