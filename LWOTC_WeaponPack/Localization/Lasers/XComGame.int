Summary="Using our new understanding of alien weapon systems, we should be able develop designs for powerful laser weaponry."
CodeName="Linebacker"
LongDescription="By studying the methods used by the aliens to manage energy consumption and heat dissipation in their weapons, we've built a working prototype of what we're calling a pulsed laser weapon, although some of the troops prefer to call them 'blasters' for reasons that are obscure to me. The power we are able to put through these weapons is immense, but the system cannot maintain a continuous beam of such massive energies, so it instead relies on a series of picosecond-long pulses of intense energy density to break down any chemical bonds the beam encounters. These weapons should be more accurate and do more damage, on average, than the ballistic weapons we have been using, although they don't quite match the firepower of the weaponry we have seen the aliens operating.
